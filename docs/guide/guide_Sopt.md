# **State optimization**
The probe state is expanded as $|\psi\rangle=\sum_i c_i|i\rangle$ in a specific
basis, i.e., $\{|i\rangle\langle i|\}$. In state optimization, the search of the
optimal probe states is equal to search of the normalized complex coefficients
$\{c_i\}$. In QuanEstimation, the state optimization algorithms are include 
automatic differentiation (AD), particle swarm optimization (PSO), 
differential evolution (DE), deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG)
and Nelder-Mead (NM).
