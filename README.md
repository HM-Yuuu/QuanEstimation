[![Dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-dev-blue.svg)](https://quanestimation.github.io/QuanEstimation/)

QuanEstimation is a Python-Julia based open-source toolkit for quantum parameter estimation, which consist in the calculation of the quantum metrological tools and quantum resources, the optimization of the probe state, control and measurement in quantum metrology. Futhermore, QuanEstimation can also perform comprehensive optimization with respect to the probe state, control and measurement to generate not only optimal quantum parameter estimation schemes, but also adaptive measurement schemes. 

## Documentation

## Notes
Welcome to the QuanEstimation community! Feel free to submit issues and pull requests.

## Installation
Run the command in the terminal to install QuanEstimation:  

~~~
pip install quanestimation
~~~

P.S. Currently, installation under Winodws and MacOS may fail due to problems on precomplielations of julia pkgs, please try under Linux or inside a docker image.
